# Part 1 : turning graphs into adjacency lists and matrices

Given the following graphs, create their adjacency matrices and adjacency lists:

If the graphs below are not visible, switch to the parent directory, go to the directory called www and find graph_1.JPG and graph_2.JPG.

## Graph 1:
![kite](../Assignments/www/graph_1.JPG)

## Graph 2:
![unbalanced tree](../Assignments/www/graph_2.JPG)

## Graph 3: random directory logic

You are given a bunch of files and folders. Draw a graph of the files and folders, and also a modified adjacency matrix **or** list (note that for graph three you only need to supply one of these). Here 

## For the graphs above answer these questions:

Is the graph a tree? why or why not (if it is, prove why, if it isn't give a proof by contradiction)?
